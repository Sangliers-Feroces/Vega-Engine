Welcome in the Gl Map Editor !!
First of all the only argument the programm need is the strenght of the map
it will define the relief on the map. By default it's set at 0.28f but you can enter any number between 0.0f and inf. But avoid value bigger than 0.75f
Here is a short description of the six tools we gave you :
                    ->MOVE<-
With the Move tool you'll be able to select one or few vertices
and move them following the XYZ axes.
                    ->PAINT<-
With the paint tool you'll be able to paint any triangle in the world
with the Binded texture.
                   ->TEXTURE<-
With the texture tools you'll be able to select the texture you want to
apply. All the textures are located in "./res/textures/". You are free
to add any texture the programm will take in parametter.
                ->Lightmap Computer<-
With this tool you will acces the "lightmap compute" menu where you'll be able
to generate lightmap with a ray's density from 10 to 100000. CARE big density
can take a long time depending on your config.
                    ->FPS MODE<-
